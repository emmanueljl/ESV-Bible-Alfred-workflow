# Alfred workflow: ESV Bible
This workflow allows you to quickly look up bible passages and copy them to your clipboard. It submits passage reference queries to the wonderful ESV API (https://api.esv.org/) and parses the response. The API is smart enough to handle many variations and abbreviations!

**Note:** I have deliberately chosen not to redact this workflow's approved API key, and kept it unhidden in the code. Your use of the API key is subject to the conditions laid out in the [ESV API usage guidelines](https://api.esv.org/).
