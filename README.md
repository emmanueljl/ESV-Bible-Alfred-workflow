# ESV-Bible-Alfred-workflow
This workflow allows you to quickly look up bible passages and copy them to your clipboard. It submits passage reference queries to the wonderful ESV Bible Web Service API (http://www.esvapi.org/) and parses the response. The API is smart enough to handle many variations and abbreviations!
