# Alfred workflow: ESV Bible
This workflow allows you to quickly look up bible passages and copy them to your clipboard. It submits passage reference queries to the wonderful ESV API (https://api.esv.org/) and parses the response. The API is smart enough to handle many variations and abbreviations!
